A collection of PowerShell malware techniques I've come across while examining malware. 

All samples are harmless (relatively speaking. Non-malicious files are dropped and changes enacted). They will (hopefully) trigger alerts, however. 

Most samples are taken/inspired from malware samples. Typically, links to related blog post analyses will be included in the code samples. 

# Persistence examples
* Persistence_001
  * Registry file association changes
  * Startup shortcut creation

# Process Injection
* ProcessInjection_001
  * Shellcode injection into the active terminal process
