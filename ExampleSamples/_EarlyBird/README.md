This is a PowerShell (mostly C# lmao) implementation of the Early Bird APC Injection from [AlionGreen](https://github.com/AlionGreen/apc-injection/blob/main/early-bird/main.c).

### inj

The Early Bird payload. Targets notepad.exe for injection. Uses `Add-Type` to add in C# code for manipulating the process. The C# code is converted to a Base64 string, AES encrypted, and BXOR'd. Shellcode is similarly obfuscated. IT just launches calc.exe,. Everything is decoded dynamically. This is really just a "for fun" sample, so I didn't put much effort into obfuscation or anything. Things are basically what they say they are. Blog post going into more detail (+ a funny story) incoming.

This sample has already been uploaded to a bunch of places as well.
